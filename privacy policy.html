<!--
IMPORTANT: Things to keep in mind if you ever want to restyle anything: 
1. Keep the ID and CLASS stuff in - if deleted or replaced make sure to also delete or replace in the style.css page - that way the CSS will transfer over 
      1a. There is also javascript code in here, which calls the class and id names I set, so if replaced, please watch out for that 

2. If you plan on moving the images to a different folder or rename the images folder, remember to also fix the file paths to each image
